The game operates on a randomized basis, distinguishing it from deterministic games like chess. In this game, players adopt a mixed strategy, where each move is chosen with an equal probability of 20%. Unlike deterministic games where players can influence their opponents by changing strategies, the randomness in this game ensures that each move has an equal likelihood of being chosen. This introduces an element of unpredictability and chance, making strategic decision-making crucial while embracing the inherent uncertainty of the game.
